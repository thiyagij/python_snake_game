                        *
```

## 🏗️ Code Refactoring

### Modular Architecture
Created a modular version with separate concerns:

**New Modules**:
1. **game_config.py**: Configuration constants
   - Game settings (refresh rate, points, etc.)
   - Display characters
   - File paths
   - Window dimensions

2. **score_manager.py**: High score persistence
   - Load scores from JSON
   - Save scores to JSON
   - Graceful error handling

3. **game_renderer.py**: Display operations
   - Draw border, title, instructions
   - Draw snake and food
   - Draw scores
   - Game over screen

4. **snake_game_modular.py**: Main game with modules
   - Uses all the above modules
   - Same functionality as original
   - Better organized code

**Benefits**:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Easier to test individual components
- Easier to extend and maintain
- Better code organization
- Both versions available (monolithic and modular)

## 🔧 Setup Script Improvements

### setup.sh (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- ✅ Python 3.8+ version checking
- ✅ Support for Git Bash on Windows
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Skips recreation if venv exists
- ✅ Helpful next steps display
- ✅ Exit on error (`set -e`)

### setup.bat (Windows)

- ✅ Comprehensive error messages
- ✅ Better Windows compatibility
- ✅ Antivirus and permission hints
- ✅ Helpful next steps display
- ✅ Enhanced user experience

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### Complete Workflow
Added comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow:

**Jobs**:
1. **Lint**: Code quality checks with flake8
2. **Test**: Multi-platform, multi-version testing
   - OS: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
   - Python: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
   - Total: 15 test combinations
3. **Build**: Package building with Poetry
4. **Publish**: Package publishing (optional)
5. **Deploy Pages**: Documentation deployment

**Features**:
- ✅ Runs on every push and PR
- ✅ Automatic PR checks
- ✅ Code coverage with Codecov
- ✅ Artifact uploads
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Secrets documented in CI_CD.md

### Secrets Configuration
**Optional** (for package publishing):
- `PYPI_USERNAME`
- `PYPI_PASSWORD`

Pipeline works without secrets (publishing step is skipped).
